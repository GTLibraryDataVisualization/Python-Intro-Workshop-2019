# Python-Intro-Workshop-2019

This workshop aims to teach the basic fundamentals of python. We will be coding using python 3 specifically, but most of the concepts apply to python 2 as well. We will go over variables, types, conditionals, loops, and basic functions in the course of the workshop. This will give you a good base to figure out how to start making your own simple functions and programs going forward as well as understanding other people's code you may encounter.
